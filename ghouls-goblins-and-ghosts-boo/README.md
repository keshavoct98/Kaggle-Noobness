# ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo!

Get out your dowsing rods, electromagnetic sensors, â€¦ and gradient boosting machines. Kaggle is haunted and they need our help. After a month of making scientific observations and taking careful measurements, it was determined that 900 ghouls, ghosts, and goblins are infesting their halls and frightening data scientists. When trying garlic, asking politely, and using reverse psychology didn't work, it became clear that machine learning is the only answer to banishing our unwanted guests![.](https://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/5708/media/halloween-660x.png)

  So now the hour has come to put the data collected in our hands. They have identified 371 of the ghastly creatures, but need our help to vanquish the rest. And only an accurate classification algorithm can thwart them. Use bone length measurements, severity of rot, extent of soullessness, and other characteristics to distinguish (and extinguish) the intruders.
